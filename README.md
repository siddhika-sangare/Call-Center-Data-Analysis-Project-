# Call-Center-Data-Analysis-Project
PowerBI Project- Call Center Dashboard Project

## Aim :
The aim is to provide transparent and concise insights to call center client about their long term trends in customer and agent behaviour.

Created interactive dashboard and report that transformed raw data into clear, actionable insights. This work helped the client make informed decisions by providing them with easy-to-understand visual representations of their key metrics.

Below are some relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics in the dataset that I considered :
- Overall customer satisfaction
- Overall calls answered/abandoned
- Calls by time
- Average speed of answer
- Agentâ€™s performance quadrant -> average handle time (talk duration) vs calls answered
